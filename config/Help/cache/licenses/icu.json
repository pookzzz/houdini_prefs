The term\n #        \"use\" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,\n #        modification, copying and distribution of the program and the\n #        production of secondary products from the program.\n #        \n #        In the case where the program, whether in its original form or\n #        modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from\n #        any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or\n #        grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in\n #        writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted\n #        from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted\n #        above as far as the program is concerned.\n #        \n #        ---------------COPYING.ipadic-----END------------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Time Zone Database\n\nICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for\nits time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP\n175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.\n\n7.  Database Ownership\n\n   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\n   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\n   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public\n   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply\n   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.\n   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,\n   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in\n   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,\n   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court\n   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust\n   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the\n   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that\n   contribution or in the TZ Database.\n\n"], "extent": [21, 18093]}], "title": ["ICU"]}
