The following is\nintended to summarize the copyright status of the individual files;\nthe actual statements in the files are controlling.\n\n* Except as listed below, all C sources (including .c and .h files)\n  and documentation files are subject to the copyright notice reproduced\n  at the bottom of this file.\n\n* The following source files are also subject in whole or in part to\n  a 3-clause UC Regents copyright; please read the individual source\n  files for details:\n   libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c\n   libarchive/archive_write_add_filter_compress.c\n   libarchive/mtree.5\n\n* The following source files are in the public domain:\n   libarchive/archive_getdate.c\n\n* The following source files are triple-licensed with the ability to choose\n  from CC0 1.0 Universal, OpenSSL or Apache 2.0 licenses:\n   libarchive/archive_blake2.h\n   libarchive/archive_blake2_impl.h\n   libarchive/archive_blake2s_ref.c\n   libarchive/archive_blake2sp_ref.c\n\n* The build files---including Makefiles, configure scripts,\n  and auxiliary scripts used as part of the compile process---have\n  widely varying licensing terms.  Please check individual files before\n  distributing them to see if those restrictions apply to you.\n\nI intend for all new source code to use the license below and hope over\ntime to replace code with other licenses with new implementations that\ndo use the license below.  The varying licensing of the build scripts\nseems to be an unavoidable mess.\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2003-2018 <author(s)>\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\nare met:\n1.
